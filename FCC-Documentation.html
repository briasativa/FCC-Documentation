        Once you have your HTML the way you want it, now what? The nest step to realizing your new website is to format the words the way you imagined for your finished site. When writing a document in Word or Google Docs, or another word processor, you can size your text, change color, bold or underline, even number your document to present the information as needed.
        With minor adjustments to your HTML, you can do the same with CSS. If you have been writing HTML, you may already know some CSS. Here we will demystify the text manipulation all in one place.</p>

       There are a few ways to style the text. There are more complicated or combined ways to select styles but we're sticking to the basics for this document. The main ways are</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Inline</li>
       <li>Style Block</li>
       <li>Element Selectors</li>
       <li>ID Selectors</li>
       <li>Class Selectors</li>

     <p> You've may have already been been changing the style of the text or elements with inline selectors or using a style block. If not, here are examples of these.
     </p>
<code> <p color:red;>Hello World!</p>
     </code>

       JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
       have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
       be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
       you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
       function return types are not explicitly typed.

      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
      </code>

      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
      browser!

      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
      names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
      dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
      JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
      "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as 책 and 체 in identifiers.
      You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
      identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
      _name.

      You can declare a variable in three ways:
      <p>
        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
        below.

        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
        is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code>
